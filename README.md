Note -> This project is not fully completed, though project is fully working and core is fully completed,
BUt it is not structured and styled well, 
due to my clg exams I am giving very less time to this,
but by the end of exams it will be completed.

This is a Practice Project, 
Where I implmented concepts of REST_CLASS apis,
Practiced CRUD operations,

CREATE -> CREATE NEW POST 
READ -> GET FULL VIEW OF SINGLE POST  
UPDATE -> UPDATING CAPTIONS OF POST USING PATCH REQUEST 
DELETE -> DELETING POST USING DELETE REQ

TEXT STACK -> Used basic HTML, CSS JS along with Node js, Express, Ejs.
